# mRNA Subcellular Localization Predictor
A machine learning-based tool to predict the subcellular localization of mRNA

## Data folder
Contains 4 floders:
* IDS_I: Independent Dataset I : 
         First test datasets used for testing only. These include Nine sublocalizations.
* IDS_II: ndependent Dataset II: 
         Second test data set used for testing only. These include Nine sublocalizations.
* TEST_01: Testset_01: 
         Independent dataset files used for testing only.
* Train: Training Dataset: 
         Contains all five Fasta Sequence Files used to train MLP models. The fifth one is a combination of all Fastafiles.

## Code Folder:
* Shap analysis Jupyter Notebook
